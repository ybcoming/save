    a. turn swap off
    
      The setting is from 0 to 100, with lower values meaning a lower likelihood of swapping. The default is usually 60 - 
      you can check this by running:
      sysctl vm.swappiness
      
      The default setting encourages the server to use swap. Since there probably won't be much else on the database server
      besides MariaDB processes to put into swap, you'll probably want to reduce this to zero to avoid swapping as much as 
      possible. You can change the default by adding a line to the sysctl.conf file (usually found in /etc/sysctl.conf).

      To set the swappiness to zero, add the line:
      vm.swappiness = 0
      
      This normally takes effect after a reboot, but you can change the value without rebooting as follows:
      sysctl -w vm.swappiness=0
      
    b. filesystem
    
       the best Linux filesystems are generally regarded as ext4, XFS and Btrfs.
       
       Disabling access time
        It's unlikely you'll need to record file access time on a database server, 
        and mounting your filesystem with this disabled can give an easy improvement in performance. 
        To do so, use the noatime option.

        If you want to keep access time for log files or other system files, these can be stored on a separate drive.
        
2. 硬件
    
      memory: highest RAM size per slot is preferable
      cpu:    Besides processor speed, the processor's bus speed and cache size are also important factors to consider.
      disk:   choose disks with as low a seek time as possible. add dedicated disks for temporary files and transaction logs.
